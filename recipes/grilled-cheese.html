    <p>The grilled cheese sandwich is one of the oldest, most influental recipes of the human era. There</p>
    <p>is evidence suggesting the grilled cheese can be dated all the way back to the Paleolithic period</p>
    <p>(when when the woolly mammoth still roamed the earth!). Can you imagine only having rocks and</p>
    <p>sticks and trying to conjure up a grilled cheese sandwich? I don't know how they did it, I guess</p>
    <p>that's a testiment to how creative and resilient humans are. Anyway, here is a simple way to</p>
    <p>recreate (in the most modern, lazy sense of the word) a grilled cheese sandwich! I hope you find</p>
    <p>it easy and helpful, enjoy!</p>
